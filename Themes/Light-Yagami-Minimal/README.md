# Light Yagami Minimal Theme

This theme removes all the text and buttons on the top and bottom of the page (ie. logo, typing button, settings button, paypal link) meaning you should be comfortable with navigating through MonkeyType using its built-in command line.

If you would prefer to keep all the GUI elements, no worries! Simply comment out the #top and/or #bottom IDs and everything will appear again.

Depending on your monitor and window size, you may need to play around with the **background-size**, **background-position**, and **right** variables. You could also try changing the width in MonkeyType's preferences page.
