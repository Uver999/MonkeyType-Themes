# MonkeyType-Themes
My custom themes for MonkeyType

To apply these (only one right now):

- Download the Stylus extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/)).

- Navigate to [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com).

- Click the Stylus extension in your address bar.

- Click "Write style for: monkeytype.com" (not "monkeytype.com/this_URL").

- Copy/paste the code from the css.txt file (in the theme folder of your choosing) in between the curly brackets after '@-moz-document domain("monkeytype.com")'.

- Name and save the theme and check that it is working on MonkeyType (you may need to reload MonkeyType if you do not have **live preview** enabled).

- Use the MonkeyType custom theme link in whatever theme folder you chose to use to theme the actual text or create one of your own if you prefer.

That's it! Feel free to edit these however you please and enjoy!
