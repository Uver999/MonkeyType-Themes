My custom themes for MonkeyType

To apply these (only one right now):

- Download the Stylus extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/))

- Navigate to [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com)

- Click the extension in your address bar

- Click "Write style for: monkeytype.com"

- Copy/paste the css from the .txt file in the theme folder. 

- Name and save the theme and check that it is working on MonkeyType (you may need to reload MonkeyType if you do not have **live preview** enabled).

- Use the MonkeyType custom theme link in whatever theme folder you chose or create your own if you prefer to theme the actual text.

That's it! Feel free to edit them however you please and enjoy!
